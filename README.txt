Instructions on installing and running the game:
Above the list of files, click on the green button that says "Code" and download as ZIP.
Once the ZIP File is downloaded, extract it.
To run the game you must have the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.
If you don't have the lastest version of the JRE, you can download and install it from here: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-windows
Finally, if java is installed, you can run the game by double clicking the GravityRoom.jar file.

VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:
Though Java is cross-platform, I can only guarantee that the game runs properly on machines running Windows 10.
I cannot say at all if it will run properly on macOS.
As for Linux distributions, I only know that the game DOES NOT run properly on Solus. Other distributions may work fine, but I can't say for sure.
The application should at least be able to start on all Windows 10, macOS, and Linux. But consistent behavior of the application is not guaranteed.
The game WILL NOT run on ChromeOS, as it does not support Java.
